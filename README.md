# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to display UFO sighting information in a filterable table. This allows people to be able to search through UFO sighting data based on city, state, country, date, and shape. This makes the data easier to access for those interested in UFO sightings and easier to parse through to find relevant information.

## Results

Using and filter the table is easy. When first opening the webpage, the contents of the table are displayed in no specific order.

To filter for one or more items, enter the search term into one of the five search boxes on the right hand side. Be sure to follow the example text for proper formatting. Press enter when you are done entering in the search parameter to refresh the table.

Continue to add search parameters in the search boxes until you have added all the filters you would like.

When you wish to remove a filter, delete the text in the respective search box and press enter. You may also refresh the page to return the table to it's original, unfiltered state.

## Summary

### Drawbacks
A drawback of this new design is that since the filters are input boxes instead of drop-down menus, it can be hard for a user to know what are the options to search for. This can result in wasted time searching, for example, for shapes that have no entries.

Another drawback of this design is that it doesn't allow you to sort the results. Sorting results could be very helpful in searching throuh information. For example, if you wanted to look for data about a certain city and you wanted to see the data in chronological order, or sorted by date, you wouldn't be able to. You would have to look at the data from a certain city in no specific order.

### Recommendations
A recommendation to improve upon this design would be to allow the user to select an item in the table to view in another window. Not all of the comments for each entry can be fully seen in the current design, so it would be nice if the user could select the item to be able to view the whole comment section.

Another recommendation would be to standardize the duration data so that it could be added as a search filter. Currently, the duration data is not uniform (for example min vs minutes) which makes it hard to use it as a filter.
